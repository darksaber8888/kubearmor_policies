KubeArmor is a runtime security enforcement system for Kubernetes, which helps in protecting your containers by enforcing security policies at the system level. It allows you to define policies that can restrict system calls, file access, and network communication, providing an additional layer of security beyond the capabilities of Kubernetes' built-in features. KubeArmor is particularly useful in mitigating risks from container vulnerabilities and potential runtime attacks.

**Steps to Install KubeArmor on a Kubernetes Cluster**

**Add the KubeArmor Helm Repository**__
1. Add the official KubeArmor Helm repository to your Helm client:

helm repo add kubearmor https://kubearmor.github.io/charts/

**Update Helm Repositories**__
3. Update your Helm repositories to ensure you have the latest charts available:

helm repo update

**Install KubeArmor**__
4. Install KubeArmor using Helm in your Kubernetes cluster: This command deploys KubeArmor in the kubearmor namespace. It installs all the necessary components, including the KubeArmor Controller, DaemonSets, and CRDs (Custom Resource Definitions) required for policy enforcement.

helm install kubearmor kubearmor/kubearmor --namespace kubearmor --create-namespace

**Verify the Installation**__
5. Check the status of the KubeArmor components to ensure they are running correctly: All pods should be in a Running state, indicating that KubeArmor is successfully installed.

kubectl get pods -n kubearmor

**Apply Security Policies**__
6. Define and apply security policies according to your needs: Policies can be written in YAML format and specify rules to restrict file access, process execution, network communication, and other system-level operations.

kubectl apply -f fileaccess.yaml -n myapp
